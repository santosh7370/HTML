			<h1> About Us</h1>
			<p>I am excited about joining the BE.CSE (Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering) course for several reasons. Firstly, I have always been fascinated by computers and technology. From a young age, I found myself drawn to coding, software development, and problem- solving. Pursuing BE.CSE will allow me to delve deeper into these areas and gain a comprehensive understanding of computer science.Secondly, the field of computer science is constantly evolving, offering endless opportunities for innovation and growth.</p>
